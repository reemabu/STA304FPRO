Catholic school and public school are the two main public schooling systems in North America. Weather attending Catholic primary school has a significant effect on math and reading scores has long been a contentious issue. It was hypothesized that attending Catholic school has little or no effect on math and reading scores. Using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-1999 a propensity scores matching algorithm was implemented. It was found that Catholic schooling had a statistical small negative effect on math scores and negligible results on reading scores.

The project is organised as follows: the raw data can be found in the imputs folder, the codes can be found in the scripts folder and the rmarkdown, pdf and refrences are in the outputs folder.
